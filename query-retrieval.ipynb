According to the booking.com website, the apartments can be booked from next week.

Despite its Soviet overtones, the huge celebration was a boost to the self-esteem of Vilnius University as the oldest university in Eastern Europe (older than Moscow University).In 1987, the first unsanctioned rally was held at the monument to Adam Mickiewicz, publicly denouncing the secret protocols of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact of 23 August 1939. The August 1988 rally in Vingio Park and the September rally in Cathedral Square, violently attacked by the police, became symbols of the “Singing Revolution”.On 22 October 1988, the Sąjūdis congress proclaimed the return of the Cathedral, which was used as a museum, to the Catholic Church. In the morning of 23 October, Lithuanian bishops and Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevičius celebrated the Mass at the door of the Cathedral.On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR in Vilnius proclaimed Lithuania’s independence.On 13 January 1991, in last-ditch attempt to regain control, Soviet tanks, armoured personnel carriers and armed soldiers stormed the Vilnius TV Tower and the Lithuanian Radio and Television building. Fourteen civilians were killed and over a thousand wounded.The capital of independent LithuaniaOn 23 August 1991, the City Council decided to remove the Lenin monument in Lukiškių Square. The images of the Soviet monument being dismantled amidst shouts of joy and applause went around the world.In 1992 and 2000, the Polish Nobel Prize-winning author and graduate of Stepan Batory University Czesław Miłosz visited Vilnius and his alma mater. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Miłosz’s birth, a plaque was unveiled in the Sarbievius Courtyard of Vilnius University.On 17 December 1994, the historic centre of Vilnius was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.On 22 September 1996, at the foot of Gediminas Hill, near the Cathedral, a monument to Grand Duke Gediminas was unveiled, designed by the Lithuanian expatriate sculptor Vytautas Kašuba and made by the sculptor Mindaugas Šnipas. The monument was hotly debated at the time, with controversy surrounding both its artistic solution and the chosen location.On 1 January 2009, Vilnius became the European Capital of Culture. Around 1,500 events took place during the year, attended by around 1.5 million people.On 6 July 2018, the completed Palace of the Grand Dukes was inaugurated in Vilnius. The Palace of the Grand Dukes, which was demolished 200 years ago, was rebuilt over the excavated remains of the original edifice. The first part of the palace was opened to visitors in 2013, but the entire construction took 15 years and cost over 100 million euros.On 6 October 2018, partisan commander Adolfas Ramanauskas-Vanagas was honoured with a state funeral. His remains, found a few months previously in the Orphans’ Cemetery, were ceremoniously reburied in the Pantheon of Heads of State in Antakalnis Cemetery.In July 2019, Lukiškės Prison in the centre of Vilnius was closed after its last inmates were moved out. The complex of buildings, built in 1904 and recognised as a cultural heritage site, became an events space.After 24 February 2022, Vilnius welcomed refugees from Ukraine and held numerous support rallies for the country under attack. More than 20,000 refugees from Ukraine have taken refuge in Vilnius.
